        desc_flood =  '<b>Climate change helped cause massive floods in Louisiana.</b> <br><br> Climate change increases the intensity of precipitation because warm weather leads more water to evaporate forming wetter clouds. South Louisiana received nearly 30 inches of rain between August 10 and 17. 13 people died in the floods, which inundated Baton Rouge and destroyed 60,000 homes. <br> <br> <a href="Learn More">https://time.com/4482109/climate-change-louisiana-flooding/</a>'

Since then the number has decreased to fewer than 30, and most of those remaining have shrunk in area by two-thirds. It is predicted that within 30 years most if not all of the park\'s namesake glaciers will disappear. <br> <br> <a href="Learn More">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/</a>'
